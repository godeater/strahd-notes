Card 1
---
"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy. What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors."

[[Cast of Characters#^2f88ff|Danika]] thinks the location this refers to is the [[Locations#Amber Temple|Amber temple]], located on [[Locations#Mount Ghakis|Mount Ghakis]]. 

Some sort of artefact we can find which has information about Strahd's origins. Maybe how we has become who he is today, and maybe (if we're lucky) some hints on how to defeat him.

Card 2
---
"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope. I see a sleeping prince, a servant of light and the brother of darkness. The treasure lies with him."

We think that's talking about [[Cast of Characters#^c102c4|Strahd's brother]]. From the conversations we had with the Vistani at the camp afterwards, they told us that "Strahd betrayed his brother and killed him." [[Cast of Characters#^2f88ff|Danika]] told us that [[Cast of Characters#^c102c4|Strahd's brother]] is entombed in the castle. 

Card 3
---
"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight. Look to the west. Find a pool blessed by the light of the white sun."

[[Cast of Characters#^2f88ff|Danika]] thought the location being referred to here is a pool near to [[Locations#Krezk|Krezk]]. The [[Cast of Characters#^727c68|burgomaster of Krezk]] seems to have hinted this is true.

Card 4
---
"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against this darkness. I see a child - a Vistana. You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake!"

[[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] believes this to be [[Cast of Characters#^c85e3a|Ezmerelda]] since we found her near a lake, and she is apparently a Vistana. [[Cast of Characters#^99283f|Clank]] is still extremely doubtful of this. She doesn't meet any other criteria of the reading. She's _not_ a child, and when we found her, her fate was definitely not hanging in the balance.

Card 5
---
"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him! I see a dark figure on a balcony, looking down upon this tortured land with a twisted smile."

Some particular location in his castle? We won't really know if this is helpful until we've got there and had a look around.
