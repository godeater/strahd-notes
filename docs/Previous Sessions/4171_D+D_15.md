We all wake up from our disturbed sleep and discuss the nature of our relationship
with [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]] and the [[Groups#Keepers of the Feather|Keepers of the Feather]].
We are visited by a were-raven who tells us thanks for helping his family, but that
we must still help recover that which was stolen.

We formulate a rough plan to steal a gem back from the druids (via the location
and map on the scroll we found on the murdered druid last session). The approach
we voted on is to get [[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]] to attempt to steal it.

[[Cast of Characters#^26498f|Elvir]] (youngest son), [[Cast of Characters#^7c86d8|Stefania]] (eldest daughter), [[Cast of Characters#^6fbf3a|Claudiu]], [[Cast of Characters#^8145ce|Adrian]] are eating breakfast.
[[Cast of Characters#^565932|Davian]] arrives and sits down at the table too.

He mentions a swamp woman off to the east. [[Cast of Characters#^0b9829|Baba Lysaga]].

There's some wine tasting. Turns out it's poisoned.
[[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] does a ritual to purify one vat.

We talk to [[Cast of Characters#^565932|Davian]] upstairs. [[Cast of Characters#^99283f|Clank]] notices a druid.
[[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]] follows it. the party splits.
Most people go outside to find the cellar door.
[[Cast of Characters#^99283f|Clank]] runs after [[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]]

Everyone catches up to the Druid in the cellar, from two different directions.
