We are waylaid on the bridge over the river by a [[Creatures Encountered#^e7d86d|clown on a unicycle]], a number of [[Creatures Encountered#^1e79c6|undead villagers]], and a [[Creatures Encountered#^93ebf2|giant toad]].

We survive with minimal damage.

We acquire a [[Creatures Encountered#^48ea6e|donkey]], and a book describing some knights.
It wants us to go to a tower north west of where we are, but we don't want to go that way.
The Oath Celestial Order of the Dragon. #SIDEQUEST 
Feathers (black) appear in the same pouch on the [[Creatures Encountered#^48ea6e|donkey]] that the book came from.
Phial of black liquid with the feathers (ink)

We go to the [[Creatures Encountered#^48ea6e|donkey]] owner's tower, there is an iron door with no handle or hinges.
It has writing on it saying "Khazan".
It also has a diagram of figures connected by a path.

[[Cast of Characters#^8af613|Grond]] dances following the figures movements - but gets it wrong.
A [[Creatures Encountered#^bb4fed|dragon]] appears and attacks us.
[[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] gets hurt a lot.
[[Cast of Characters#^8af613|Grond]] redoes his dance properly. The [[Creatures Encountered#^bb4fed|dragon]] disappears and the door opens.
