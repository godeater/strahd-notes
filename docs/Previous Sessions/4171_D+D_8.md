The upper floor of the coffin maker's.

Quite a few vampire spawn are a bit upset that we're here.

[[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] and [[Cast of Characters#^8af613|Grond]] head for the pub.

[[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]], [[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] and [[Cast of Characters#^99283f|Clank]] head for the church.
