On the road to [[Locations#Krezk|Krezk]].

[[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] chats with [[Cast of Characters#^c85e3a|Ezmerelda]]. 
She'd tried to infiltrate [[Locations#Castle Ravenloft|Castle Ravenloft]] (a ten day ago??) got discovered and injured whilst trying to escape.
She didn't discover any useful info whilst she was there.

[[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] gives the bracelet he got from [[Cast of Characters#^565932|Davian]] to [[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] so that it can be identified.

[[Cast of Characters#^f8a586|van Richten]] rescued her from an abusive family.
He left her, but then she tracked him down again two years later, and joined him.
[[Cast of Characters#^f8a586|van Richten]] had to kill his own son. (Undead?)

[[Cast of Characters#^c85e3a|Ezmerelda]] and he parted company on bad terms - but now she's trying to find him again.

[[Cast of Characters#^f8a586|van Richten]] ended up here - some how got the [[Groups#Vistani|Vistani]] to take him here.

As we continue into the valley before [[Locations#Krezk|Krezk]] - we here wolf howls. Otherworldly wolf howls.

We have a fight with some werewolves. [[Cast of Characters#^8af613|Grond]] is bitten by one and fails his save.
[[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] finds a giant copper coin with a wolf's head on it.

We arrive at [[Locations#Krezk|Krezk]], and have to argue our way in, as the guards are unwilling to grant us entry. Whilst the argument goes on, [[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] finishes identifying the bracelet [[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] got - it's +1 CON. Eventually the [[Cast of Characters#^48f977|burgomaster]] turns up and orders us admitted, and escorted to the Inn for shelter. He says he wants to speak to us again in the morning.

Apparently it's not really an Inn - just somewhere they put up strangers. Warmth and food. The guard says there _is_ no Inn in town.

[[Cast of Characters#^99283f|Clank]] searches the room and finds some hard rations and a bronze dagger.

[[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]] notices there's someone outside the door. [[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] opens it and invites him in. The guard refuses.
We settle in for a long rest. Seems we all have bad dreams of [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]] again.

We wake up to someone knocking on the door very early. A man dressed in peasant clothing clutching a spear is there. We're summoned to see the [[Cast of Characters#^48f977|burgomaster]]. The guard doesn't want to join us for breakfast. 

[[Cast of Characters#^48f977|Dmitri Krezkov]] is the name of the town's burgomaster.
[[Cast of Characters#^dabc5c|Anna Krezkov]] is his wife.

At the burgomaster's demand to know why we are here, [[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] throws the wolf coin on the floor to show that we bring aid to the village by destroying the werewolves.

[[Cast of Characters#^727c68|Dmitri]] tells us:
There is a Pool of the white sun - in the village. It stays warm all year round.
There is a statue at the pool forever looking over it. He won't tell us who the status is of - it's not of the morning lord.   

[[Cast of Characters#^727c68|Dmitri]] tells us that there is a werewolf den to the west of Krezk.
He also mentions something he refers to as "[[Cast of Characters#^c102c4|Sergei's]] legacy" -  maybe that is what we are seeking?
The village holds a powerful artefact, to which he'll grant us access - though the path is difficult.

He says that "[[Cast of Characters#^c102c4|Sergei]] was murdered by....."(he never finishes the sentence)
and then continues, "I believe that part of his soul seeks radiance our morning lord can give. You should speak to the [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]]."

[[Cast of Characters#^aaf0b6|Cub]] starts asking about tea?!

[[Locations#Krezk|Krezk]] claims to be completely self sufficient. [[Cast of Characters#^727c68|Dmitri]] claims the morning lord still has influence here. 
The [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] is asking the [[Cast of Characters#^48f977|burgomaster]] for help. 

The [[Cast of Characters#^48f977|Burgomaster's]] son died in the last two days - they've lost all four of their children now. They died of some affliction.

The [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] occasionally works miracles.
[[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] appears forever youthful. Creatures that keep him company are strange and perverse.
We're told the [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] seeks to help, yet he could be fallen - corrupted.

[[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] came to [[Locations#Krezk|Krezk]] many generations ago. He occupied the abbey, the last stronghold against the darkness of [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]]. 
[[Cast of Characters#^ac1bb8|Saint Markovia]] held out there against Strahd. Now the abbey has fallen. [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] offers to restore people to life, but any who are returned are "different".
They become mongrel folk, twisted combinations of things. 

The [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] is preparing a gift for [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]].

Two things [[Cast of Characters#^727c68|Dmitri]] would ask of us:
1) We want wine. [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot]] demands it.
2) [[Cast of Characters#^dabc5c|Anna]] wants a wedding dress from [[Locations#Vallaki|Vallaki]] - for a bride for [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]]. The bride is a construct of the [[Cast of Characters#^274271|Abbot's]]?
