Matt is playing Kosron, and Emma is playing Ezmerelda.</p> <p>Kosron goes over to the smoking ruins of the cart / coffin. He inspects the remains of the coffin, and finds an indentation in the lining - the head of which clearly shows that the head that was there had two horns. For some reason he decides to climb into the coffin and lay down in the indentation. He gets out again pretty quickly, and attempts to use his \"Control Flames\" ability to set fire to the lining of the coffin, but the entire thing is apparently entirely fire proof.</p> <p>The two revenants speak to those of us instead. Their master is waiting to see us if we wish to. One of them seems quite depressed and claims there's nothing can be done to change their fate. The other seems keen for us to see the man in charge.</p> <p>The knights history is that they fought against Strahd and lost. Argynvost is the name of the silver dragon, Argynvostholt is the name of the location.</p> <p>Despite our claims to having arrived here by mistake they don't believe us for some reason.</p> <p>Lord Vladimir is the name of their leader.</p> <p>The \"Armed\" (Argynstult?) revenant slaps the other one (\"Arm less\") in mid sentence.</p> <p>The Armed one spots Kosron's dragon mark as soon as he enters and gets very excited about it.</p> <p>We're told to seek \"Sir Godfrey\" by the arm less one. The armed one is not so keen on this advice and slaps him again. Sir Godfrey may be dead. Kosron asks to go and see Vladimir.</p> <p>We share a hallucination. The hall shifts to look pristine with sunlight pouring through stained glass windows. Banners of the order of the silver dragon adorn the walls. It is warm. Righteousness and Honour are in the air. Argynvost the dragon is here. He stares at Kosron with respect. He speaks.</p> <p>\"You are not of this land. Know this, hope is not lost.\" He directs his words to Kosron.</p> <p>Then we witness a battle between the dragon and Strahd. The dragon is killed. His spirit endures. His knights linger here, they need to see the light again, and Barovia will be free.</p> <p>There is a beacon on the roof. Maybe we should light it? It will bring hope to the people of Barovia.</p> <p>We're invited again to go and see Vladimir.</p> <p>We follow the armed knight upstairs, and are taken to a throne room.</p> <p>Lord Vladimir Horneguard - leader of the Order of the Fallen Silver Dragon.</p> <p>His armour is tarnished. He's ignoring us. </p> <p>Kosron advances on the throne and calls out to him to attract his attention. He asks about the beacon. Vladimir is not wild about having it re-lit. He wants Strahd to suffer and thinks lighting the beacon will stop that somehow.</p> <p>Cub brandishes the oath celestial that we found and shows it to Vladimir after he orders us to leave. Vladimir demands Cub stand before him. Cub starts reading from the oath - about two paragraphs in this enrages Vladimir.

Indeed, I left the last campaign I was playing before I departed the UK for that reason. In that case, I think the situation was a bit more extreme - in that my decision came about because one of the players had gone into the campaign with the idea that they wanted to play a characters whose actions and views were definitely going to go against the rest of the party's - the conflict grew out of that player then choosing to complain to the DM about the way my character was treating his in the game, and that I was spoiling his fun. So rather than get into a big showdown about it - and also partly because I knew I was going to be leaving the country soon anyhow, I decided to stop playing with that group.</p> <p>I consider it an ongoing honour and privilege to play this game with you guys - and I regard all of you as friends - the first and perhaps best I've made since moving to Australia - so I'm a little bit apprehensive to do anything which might jeopardise that.</p> <p>All that being said, I've thought long and hard about what happened in the last session - I've watched the entire video that Duncan recorded of the session - and I cannot reconcile my mental picture of Clank's character being anything but abhorred by what he witnessed. To remind anyone that might have only dim recollections of the original introductions we gave - Clank is a Life Domain cleric. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Although he worships the Goddess Tymora, The Lady of Luck - in the Faer\u00fbn pantheon, she is closely allied to Lathander - sometimes called The Morning Lord - a god of the sun, and very much one of the gods of life. So to watch somewhere that is clearly sacred to those forces he so strongly identifies with (and perhaps the only such holy place within the whole of Barovia) defiled and profaned by people he thought were his friends has basically turned his world upside down.</p>"},{"location":"Conflict/2-%20Clank%27s%20speech/","title":"2  Clank's speech","text":"<p>You, Kosron! I charge you as an enemy of all the good people of Barovia. Perhaps you are in league with Strahd himself or the other Dark Powers that torment this place? Time and again I have watched you perform petty mischiefs - but today you go too far. We knew the needle you carry to be cursed beyond imagining with the foul ability to rend a mortal's very soul from their body. To watch you knowingly ask someone- who only 24 hours ago you claimed was our friend and ally against Strahd - to plunge it into this holy lake betrays your essence as evil incarnate. Perhaps you hope once again to play this off as whimsy and not malice - but I will no longer listen to such easy falsehoods as they fall from your lips. </p> <p>This action now forces me to reconsider all your prior foolishness in new light, and to wonder whether you have been set against us from the beginning? </p> <p>You insult our hosts wherever we go by refusing the societal norms of decently clothing yourself. It matters little to me, but I have perceived the shock it entails in those we meet.</p> <p>Twice you have seriously harmed your supposed allies in combat with what you claimed were unfortunate lapses of concentration - when you incinerated Cub and Grond whilst they were valiantly battling the Blue Wyrm in our first endeavour together. Then you targeted Cub when we battled the evil Githyanki at the fortress where they were sheltering Kardon from us. </p> <p>You have attacked and slain unprovoked on several occasions, the precious wildlife of our domain for your own amusement - not for survival.</p> <p>You have practised wanton vandalism in the poor village of Barovia - already much afflicted due to its proximity to the evil one's castle - but you had to add insult to injury and start burning the structures there. </p> <p>You encouraged our friend Aerin to steal and loot amongst the Vistani whilst they offered us succour from the perils of the Barovian night to only then double cross him - and reveal him in the middle of the camp for all to see.</p> <p>You perverted our attempt to slay the evil hags at the Windmill by alerting them to our intent long before any others of our party could bring their righteous might to bear on them - indeed nearly getting Aerin killed in the process. </p> <p>You continue to loot the fallen wherever opportunity presents itself, and conceal that which you find unless you yourself find no use for your spoils. </p> <p>You persuaded Grond to quit our mission of protecting the lady Irena in the accursed town of Vallaki - somehow commending to him that eating dinner was more important than the task for which we had been paid, and to which we had agreed - protect her from the vampires at all cost!</p> <p>You attempted to buy more of the poisoned pies from that hag in Vallaki - no doubt hoping to further fund their evil mission here in this blighted land.</p> <p>When we fought at the winery - you were, we were told, the sole survivor of our initial encounter with the evil druid. How were you spared, and the rest of us vanquished so easily?  And of the gem that we recovered from Yester Hill, which we were repeatedly informed by everyone else was the ultimate source of the only joy to be found in this accursed realm - you claimed it to be \"of Strahd\", and that we must relinquish it or be damned. </p> <p>You insisted we bring this Ezmerelda with us, when she had repeatedly betrayed our trust in her. You claimed she must be the ally of prophesy that Madame Eva foretold of to us. And now, you have attempted to remove her very soul from her body? Is this so you can crow over us that the ally we sought is now forever beyond our grasp? Her soul permanently imprisoned in the waters of the lake which you have so brazenly defiled?</p> <p>You are false, and I curse the day I met you. You have but one chance to redeem yourself - and that is to undo what you have wrought today - and do it now. Or there will be a reckoning.</p> <p>You, Grond - I fear for your salvation too. You have also profaned the lake and the statue to the Morning Lord - but I hope beyond hope that you can be made to see the error of what you have wrought - and that you would repent it, and repair the hurt you have caused here to me, this town, and the people of Barovia - what say you?</p>"},{"location":"Conflict/Case%20for%20the%20prosecution/","title":"Case for the prosecution","text":""},{"location":"Conflict/Case%20for%20the%20prosecution/#kosron","title":"Kosron","text":"<p>Committed further desecration of the pool by pouring Bat Urine into it.

Makes Clank question more of Kosron's previous actions that were brushed off as mistakes or miscalculations at the time: 1. His first use of Burning Hands when we were fighting the Blue Dragon wyrmling, that knocked Cub unconscious and severely injured Grond. 2. His immediate unprovoked attack on the pack of Wolves we encountered whilst pursuing Kardon. 3. His second \"accidental\" harming of Cub by hitting him with Eldritch Blast during the fight with the Githyanki at the coastal fort. 4. His unprovoked attack on the first Raven we encountered upon arriving in Barovia. 5. His wanton vandalism in the village of Barovia when he destroyed the door to a house. 6. His encouragement and help of Aerin to rob the Vistani camp where we encountered Madame Eva, when all they were doing was offering us hospitality. 7. Then immediately double crossing Aerin by causing him to reappear from thin air in the middle of the camp. 8. He ruined any chance we had of defeating the hags\u00a0at the windmill by engaging them at such long range none of the rest of the party had any hope of reaching them in time. Was this on purpose? 9. He concealed whatever artefact he found after our fight with the Banshees in the forest. 10. With Grond, also abandoned our quest to protect Irena at the church by going back to the Inn and demanding his dinner instead. 11. He attempts to buy another dream pie from the hag in Vallaki - further funding their evil? 12. He was the only one spared by the Druid when the fight at the vineyard went against us - is he in league with them? 13. He told the rest of the party that the glowing green gem we recovered from Yester Hill was \"of Strahd\" - was this a plot to remove a genuinely useful item we could have used to fight the evil here? 14.

We suggest letting it be know there will be a ceremony in Vasili's honour to see if he turns up and can enter the church.</p> <p>As we leave the church we bump into Vasili. Clank casts Detect Good and Evil. Vasili invites us to dinner, we say there's a mass tonight in his honour. Then he claims he has to leave town tonight. Then claims he'll be back late so we can come to dinner after all. He hands us a bag. Clank discovers, that as expected, Vasili is undead.</p> <p>We try to tell Father Lucian this - but he refuses to believe us. Even though we tell him the gift that Vasili has brought are not the holy bones he gathers them up and takes them to the crypt. We disregard him for any further advice.</p> <p>Bluewater Inn</p> <p>Grond is still eating his eleventy course breakfast Kosron is still chatting to Rictavio. Wayland - a smithy of some skill in the town.</p> <p>The rest of us arrive.</p> <p>Kosron goes to speak to Danika the bar keep.</p> <p>We all sit down for breakfast - Clank notices someone trying to sneak through the bar without us noticing. Clank makes eye contact with him and he gives up the attempt and comes over to speak to us. He says he has something for us. He's skinny / wiry. He's a little short.</p> <p>Fiona Wachter invites us for dinner at Wachterhouse. The date of the dinner is the Eve of St. Andral's Feast.</p> <p>Festival of the Blazing Sun is in two days time. Danika warns us that the Baron's  heart is in the right place - but his methods are not. She speaks of the souled and soulless again. Both rely on the wine they sell. They're running low on wine, and asks us to venture to the winery - \"Wizard Of Wines\" and investigate where it is. Her husband and his father are not on speaking terms. We're given directions to where the winery is - we agree to go. #SIDEQUEST </p> <p>Behind Amber Doors - Amber temple - Mount Ghakis. #SIDEQUEST Sleeping Prince - tomb is in the castle.
