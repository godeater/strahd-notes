# Vistani
Analogous to Romani. They appear to be the only group of people able to freely come and go from the realm of [[Locations#Barovia|Barovia]]. Unclear if they're in favour of [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]] or not.

# Keepers of the Feather

^ededd5

Were-ravens. Located at both the [[Locations#^367f07|Blue Water Inn]] and at the [[Locations#Wizard of Wines|Wizard of Wines]]. Seem to be mostly anti-[[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd]].

# Order of the Fallen Silver Dragon
Mentioned in passing in a document we found on the [[Creatures Encountered#^48ea6e|Donkey]] that took us to the [[Locations#Tower of Khazan|Tower]].
Knights who used to serve a Silver Dragon called [[Cast of Characters#^366a29|Argynvost]]. They are now all undead, and live in a fortress known as [[Locations#Argynvostholt|Argynvostholt]], which is partially ruined. Most of them have lost all hope of redemption.
