You, Kosron! I charge you as an enemy of all the good people of Barovia. Perhaps you are in league with Strahd himself or the other Dark Powers that torment this place? Time and again I have watched you perform petty mischiefs - but today you go too far. We knew the needle you carry to be cursed beyond imagining with the foul ability to rend a mortal's very soul from their body. To watch you knowingly ask someone- who only 24 hours ago you claimed was our friend and ally against Strahd - to plunge it into this holy lake betrays your essence as evil incarnate. Perhaps you hope once again to play this off as whimsy and not malice - but I will no longer listen to such easy falsehoods as they fall from your lips. 

This action now forces me to reconsider all your prior foolishness in new light, and to wonder whether you have been set against us from the beginning? 

You insult our hosts wherever we go by refusing the societal norms of decently clothing yourself. It matters little to me, but I have perceived the shock it entails in those we meet.

Twice you have seriously harmed your supposed allies in combat with what you claimed were unfortunate lapses of concentration - when you incinerated Cub and Grond whilst they were valiantly battling the Blue Wyrm in our first endeavour together. Then you targeted Cub when we battled the evil Githyanki at the fortress where they were sheltering Kardon from us. 

You have attacked and slain unprovoked on several occasions, the precious wildlife of our domain for your own amusement - not for survival.

You have practised wanton vandalism in the poor village of Barovia - already much afflicted due to its proximity to the evil one's castle - but you had to add insult to injury and start burning the structures there. 

You encouraged our friend Aerin to steal and loot amongst the Vistani whilst they offered us succour from the perils of the Barovian night to only then double cross him - and reveal him in the middle of the camp for all to see.

You perverted our attempt to slay the evil hags at the Windmill by alerting them to our intent long before any others of our party could bring their righteous might to bear on them - indeed nearly getting Aerin killed in the process. 

You continue to loot the fallen wherever opportunity presents itself, and conceal that which you find unless you yourself find no use for your spoils. 

You persuaded Grond to quit our mission of protecting the lady Irena in the accursed town of Vallaki - somehow commending to him that eating dinner was more important than the task for which we had been paid, and to which we had agreed - protect her from the vampires at all cost!

You attempted to buy more of the poisoned pies from that hag in Vallaki - no doubt hoping to further fund their evil mission here in this blighted land.

When we fought at the winery - you were, we were told, the sole survivor of our initial encounter with the evil druid. How were _you_ spared, and the rest of us vanquished so easily? 
And of the gem that we recovered from Yester Hill, which we were repeatedly informed by everyone else was the ultimate source of the only joy to be found in this accursed realm - you claimed it to be "of Strahd", and that we must relinquish it or be damned. 

You insisted we bring this Ezmerelda with us, when she had repeatedly betrayed our trust in her. You claimed she must be the ally of prophesy that Madame Eva foretold of to us. And now, you have attempted to remove her very soul from her body? Is this so you can crow over us that the ally we sought is now forever beyond our grasp? Her soul permanently imprisoned in the waters of the lake which you have so brazenly defiled?

You are false, and I curse the day I met you. You have but one chance to redeem yourself - and that is to undo what you have wrought today - and do it now. Or there will be a reckoning.

You, Grond - I fear for your salvation too. You have also profaned the lake and the statue to the Morning Lord - but I hope beyond hope that you can be made to see the error of what you have wrought - and that you would repent it, and repair the hurt you have caused here to me, this town, and the people of Barovia - what say you?
