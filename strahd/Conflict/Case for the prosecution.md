Kosron
---

Committed further desecration of the pool by pouring Bat Urine into it.
Persuaded Ezmerelda to use a known cursed item on the lake. Whatever the intent was, making her use an item which would remove her soul from her body is evil of the worst kind. 
Makes Clank question more of Kosron's previous actions that were brushed off as mistakes or miscalculations at the time:
1. His first use of Burning Hands when we were fighting the Blue Dragon wyrmling, that knocked Cub unconscious and severely injured Grond.
2. His immediate unprovoked attack on the pack of Wolves we encountered whilst pursuing Kardon.
3. His second "accidental" harming of Cub by hitting him with Eldritch Blast during the fight with the Githyanki at the coastal fort.
4. His unprovoked attack on the first Raven we encountered upon arriving in Barovia.
5. His wanton vandalism in the village of Barovia when he destroyed the door to a house.
6. His encouragement and help of Aerin to rob the Vistani camp where we encountered Madame Eva, when all they were doing was offering us hospitality.
7. Then immediately double crossing Aerin by causing him to reappear from thin air in the middle of the camp.
8. He ruined any chance we had of defeating the hagsÂ at the windmill by engaging them at such long range none of the rest of the party had any hope of reaching them in time. Was this on purpose?
9. He concealed whatever artefact he found after our fight with the Banshees in the forest.
10. With Grond, also abandoned our quest to protect Irena at the church by going back to the Inn and demanding his dinner instead.
11. He attempts to buy another dream pie from the hag in Vallaki - further funding their evil?
12. He was the only one spared by the Druid when the fight at the vineyard went against us - is he in league with them?
13. He told the rest of the party that the glowing green gem we recovered from Yester Hill was "of Strahd" - was this a plot to remove a genuinely useful item we could have used to fight the evil here?
14. Despite Cub and Clank's protestations - he recruited Ezmerelda into the party, claiming she was the ally Madame Eva prophesied would help us against Strahd.


Grond
---

Knocked over the statue of the Morning Lord - could have been an accident as he claims, but following it up by throwing it into the Lake makes it seems less likely. He has desecrated what might have been one of the last truly holy places in Barovia.

He also abandoned our quest to safeguard Irena in Vallaki when he refused to return to the church to help protect her, and instead decided pursuing a meal was more important.

Attempted to provoke a confrontation with Izek at the Baron of Vallaki's house.
