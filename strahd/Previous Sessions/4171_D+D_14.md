We start mid fight at the winery.
All goes pretty well until we meet a druid, who casts firestorm and takes out everyone except [[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]]

Having been saved by [[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] - we are then faced with another fleeing druid who we kill.

We search her and find a scroll.

On the body of the fallen druid at the winery, the adventurers find a weathered scroll tightly clutched in his hand. Unfurling the scroll reveals a hastily drawn map of the surrounding area with a path marked from the winery leading directly to [[Locations#Yester Hill|Yester Hill]]. Alongside the map, there's a scribbled note that reads:

"Seek the standing stones where the spirits mourn,
Under the hill's shadow, the new guardian is sworn.
Blood of the vine, to the earth it must return,
Only then will the stolen gift again burn."
