Some nobleman arrives in the camp.
He spots [[Cast of Characters#^2fb60d|Ireena]] Approaches her. He wants her to come and see him when we get to Valarki
[[Cast of Characters#^5fd4ae|Vasili von Holst]] is his name.
[[Cast of Characters#^2fb60d|Ireena]] looks flushed. She seems impressed and wants to take him up on his offer.

Then he goes to see [[Cast of Characters#^79132e|Madam Eva]], he's very respectful to her.
He was driving his carriage himself - no staff.
It's about 6:40am.

Nobody wants to talk to us this morning about [[Cast of Characters#^3b7d6a|Strahd's]] background. 

[[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]] is turned invisible by [[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] and goes and steals a bunch of cash
from the carriage. He returns to the middle of the camp where Kosron
unwisely decides to make him visible again. This upsets the people
in the camp when [[Cast of Characters#^828a30|Aerin]] reappears out of thin air.
[[Cast of Characters#^18e878|Kosron]] attempts to talk his way out of it.

The horses drawing the cart don't respond to [[Cast of Characters#^8af613|Grond's]] speak with
animals spell.

[[Cast of Characters#^5fd4ae|Vasili]] invites us to visit him when we get to [[Locations#Vallaki|Vallaki]].

We leave the camp, and follow the road.
